## What I Learned  
This project helped me improve my skills in **structuring simple layouts** and using **CSS** to style elements in a **responsive** way. I also learned how to create a **centered design** and worked with **box model** properties to make the QR code card visually appealing.  

## Ongoing Development  
I plan to continue working on improving **accessibility** and adding more features, such as **animations** or **hover effects**, to enhance the user experience.
